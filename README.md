# Disease Detection on Colonoscopy Images  

## Overview  
This project implements a deep learning-based model for disease detection in colonoscopy images. Using **ResNet50, VGG16, and InceptionV3**, the model classifies abnormalities, assisting in early diagnosis and improving medical decision-making.  

## Features  
- **Deep Learning Models:** Utilizes **ResNet50, VGG16, and InceptionV3** for image classification.  
- **Preprocessing:** Image normalization and augmentation to enhance model performance.  
- **Automated Disease Detection:** Identifies abnormalities in colonoscopy images.  
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
